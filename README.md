## Backend Configuration

By default, the extension uses our hosted backend at `https://ufd.onrender.com/api/v1`. **No local setup is required.**

### Switching Between Backends

The extension includes a built-in feature to toggle between the production and development backends:

1. Double-click on the status text at the bottom of the popup
2. Click the "Reload Extension" button that appears

### Running a Local Backend (Optional)

If you want to run your own backend:

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- FFmpeg
- yt-dlp

#### Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- **YouTube extraction errors**: Sometimes YouTube updates their systems, which can break yt-dlp extraction. If you see errors like "Failed to extract player response," try:
  - Waiting for a backend update (yt-dlp needs to be updated)
  - Using a different video
  - Making sure you're logged in to YouTube
  
- **Authentication issues**: For age-restricted or private videos, make sure you're logged in to the platform in your browser so the extension can use your cookies.

- **Download failures**: If downloads fail, check:
  - Your internet connection
  - That you're using a supported platform and URL format
  - Browser console logs for detailed error information
  - That your backend service is running (if using a local backend)

## Updating the Backend

If you're running your own backend and experience yt-dlp extraction errors, you should update yt-dlp:

1. SSH into your server or open a terminal in your local backend environment
2. Activate your virtual environment if you're using one
3. Run: `pip install -U yt-dlp`
4. Restart your backend server

For the hosted backend on Render, these updates are managed automatically.
